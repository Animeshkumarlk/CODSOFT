This Python script implements a simple to-do list application that allows users to manage tasks dynamically. It offers functionalities to add, list, and delete tasks through a user-friendly command-line interface.

#### Features

- Task Management: Users can add tasks, list existing tasks, and delete tasks based on their selection.
  
- Interactive Interface: Utilizes a loop to continuously prompt users for actions (add, delete, list, quit).
  
- Error Handling: Ensures robustness with error handling for invalid user inputs during task deletion.
  
- Dynamic Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users upon task addition and deletion.

#### Usage

1. Adding a Task:
   - Prompts the user to enter a task which is then added to the task list.
   
2. Listing Tasks:
   - Displays all current tasks with their respective indices.
   
3. Deleting a Task:
   - Allows the user to select and delete a task by its index. Handles invalid index inputs gracefully.
   
4. Exiting the Application:
   - Terminates the program when the user chooses to quit.

#### Example

Upon running the script, users are greeted with a welcome message and presented with options to manage their tasks interactively. The application ensures a seamless experience for organizing tasks efficiently.

This script demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts such as lists, loops, functions, and user input handling, making it a practical example for beginners learning Python or anyone needing a lightweight task management solution.
